          The Impact of Lifestyle Choices on Health: A Holistic Approach
        </h1>
       </div>
      <div class="paragraphs roboto-black">
          <p>
            Lifestyle habits play a significant role in overall health, influencing both physical and mental well-being. Here are several key areas where lifestyle choices can have a profound impact, along with references to support these points.
          </p>
        <h1>
          Nutrition
        </h1>
        <p>
          A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is associated with better health outcomes. Poor nutrition can lead to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Physical Activity
        </h1>
        <p>
          Regular physical activity is linked to numerous health benefits, including reduced risk of chronic diseases, improved mental health, and enhanced longevity. Sedentary behavior, on the other hand, can contribute to various health issues.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Sleep
        </h1>
        <p>
          Adequate sleep is crucial for overall health. Poor sleep quality or insufficient sleep can lead to various health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and impaired cognitive function.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Stress Management
        </h1>
        <p>
          Chronic stress can have negative effects on physical health, contributing to conditions like hypertension and immune dysfunction. Effective stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and exercise, can improve health outcomes.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Substance Use
        </h1>
        <p>
          Avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol consumption, and refraining from recreational drug use are crucial for maintaining good health. These substances are linked to a variety of health risks, including addiction and chronic diseases.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Social Connections
        </h1>
        <p>
          Social relationships and support networks are vital for mental health. Positive social interactions can improve mood, reduce stress, and even enhance physical health.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Preventive Health Measures
        </h1>
        <p>
          Regular health screenings and vaccinations play an essential role in preventing diseases and catching health issues early. Engaging in preventive health measures can significantly improve health outcomes.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Conclusion
        </h1>
        <p>
          In summary, adopting healthy lifestyle habits can lead to improved physical and mental health outcomes. The interconnectedness of these factors underscores the importance of a holistic approach to health, emphasizing the need for balanced nutrition, physical activity, adequate sleep, stress management, and social support.

        <ul>
          <li>Font choices on web page :
            <ul>
              <li>During this lab I made font choices such as using the Google font Madimi One for main headings. Paragraphs were created using a Google Font called Roboto.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sizes of headings & main text-size : 
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the main headings, I used a h1 tag with a font-size of 30 pixels to correspond with the tag corresponding to the most important title in the paragraph; in the subheadings, I used a h2 tag with a font-size of 24 pixels to differentiate it from the h1 tag. Throughout the paragraphs, I used a font-size of 17 pixels to increase reader accessibility.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Color choices : 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Throughout the paragraphs, I highlighted the main heading in white on the green background.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the first paragraph, I chose black for the text to match the color of the background. For the following paragraph, I used white on the purple background because it looks brighter when we hover, and for references, I used a default blue color and zoom effects so that users can navigate to those url's easily.  
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Margins or Padding Choices :
            <ul>
              <li>
                During the creation of the main headings, I used padding top & bottom of 1 pixels to adjust the heading in the middle of the div. In paragraphs, I used a margin-left with 4 percentage to get a gap to the left and margin-top & bottom with 10 pixels to get a gap to the top & bottom and padding with 1 pixels to frame the text to look attractive.
